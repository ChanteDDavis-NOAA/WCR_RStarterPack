"Tuesday, January 12, 2020",1:00 PM,2:30 PM,Lab time with 1:1 support,You will work with your own dataset to try out building code using some of the tools that you have learned,Chante and Diana,,Chante and Diana,"Set up an R project! 
1) Initiate a new script. 
2) Use good etiquette to organize and name things 
3)Import your data. 
4) View your data and make note of columns/rows you don't need. Also note columns/rows that you may need to create (don't worry about trying to do this yet - we'll cover it tomorrow).  

Want more practice? Try this:
1) What is the difference between Run and Source? 
2) What does the magic wand do to your formatting? 
3) What happens when you start introducing quotes? 
4) What other sections do you think you'll need in your script?"

Change the variable data types as needed (Think about using clear variables). Explore/summarize your data Create a basic linear model. Want more practice? Try this: 1) Use hist() and other base R plot commands (e.g., plot()) to investigate your data distribution. 2) Complete sections on glms and validating model assumptions. 3) Apply other (non-parametric, if appropriate) tests to your data"

Create a plot with labels and colors. Initiate a new Rmarkdown file Include your plot, a table of your model output, and explanatory text in the Rmd file Include an inline use of R in your text. Want more? Try  this: 1) Make it pretty! Work with custom themes and colors 2) Try to apply a facet wrap (multiple panels) 3) Try to export your .Rmd as a PDF, word document, or presentation and adjust formatting. "
