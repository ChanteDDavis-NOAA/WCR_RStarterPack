We will learn some best practices that are used by other coders as a statrting point for developing your own structure. In groups, you will practice developing an outline for your project and then begin to examine your dataset to identify what your outline would be. Then you'll open your own data, take a look at it and identify what needs to be changed.",TBD,TBD,TBD,
