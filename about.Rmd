<font size = 4.5> Hello Coders!

At some point over the past year we have been working on projects that would improve efficiencies, increase reproducibility and improve the consistancy of our work products.  We also recognized that there are others out would want to learn and use more R. It could be that you are relatively new to R, or that you used it a while ago so you're hoping to refresh your skills but aren't sure where to start. Whatever the case, perhaps you'd like to move more of your data or products into R but feel something is holding you back from diving in. 

<br>
If this sounds like you never fear! We put together this pilot approach that is a mix of short introductions and self-directed learning. We give you - the starteR pack!

<br>
Happy Coding!  ><((((º>  ><((((º>·.¸.·.¸.><((((º> Chanté and Diana
