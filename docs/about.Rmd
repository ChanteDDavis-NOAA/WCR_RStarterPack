## R Workshop for the NMFS Economics and Human Dimensions Program

Some time ago, in preparation for the NMFS Social Science/Human Dimensions meeting, I was part of a group that was asked to prepare content for a possible "R for Social Scientists" workshop. The idea was to offer this workshop at the Social Science/Human Dimensions meeting. Although the meeting has been canceled, our group has continued developing the content for the originally proposed R workshop.

To that end, we have developed a poll to gauge interest and get an idea of the types of content that would be most engaging for participants. We thought it was important to try and extract as much information as possible from prospective participants in order to organize the course in a way that would be beneficial to all interested parties.

The workshop will take place from from Tuesday, September 22nd - Thursday, September 24th from 9 am - 12 :00pm PST(Pacific Time)/12 pm - 3 pm EST. Once available, we will share the WebEx link to all interested participants.
