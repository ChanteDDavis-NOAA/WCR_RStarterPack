title: "Organization"
---

In this page, we will detail how we will organize the R group and events. This organization has been approved during the first formal meeting but can change with time (any good idea is welcomed!).

Some ideas are taken from the organization of the [Davis R Users' Group](https://d-rug.github.io/).

### Working sessions

The main events we want to organize are monthly working sessions of 2 hours (16h-18h probably). 

- We will host presentations/tutorials on some R topics that can be useful to many people (e.g. optimization of code, the tidyverse, Rcpp, imputation, predictive models, image/text analysis, etc.) during 30-60 min.

- During the second part of the session, people could ask and answer some questions about specific problems they encounter when coding in R. During this time, beers and sodas will be offered by the [Grenoble Alpes Data Institute](https://data-institute.univ-grenoble-alpes.fr/).

**The first goal of this R group is that people meet and learn from each other.**

### Who can attend?

Any R users, students, engineers, researchers, people from the Industry, non-french speakers are all welcomed.

### Blog

- Every presentation could be completed with a blog post hosted on the [blog of the R group](blog/).

- We could also host some blog post without having to make a presentation.

The blog will be relayed at [R-bloggers](https://www.r-bloggers.com/) which is read by dozens of thousands of people.

### Seminars

- Specific researchs topics that use R would take place in Lab seminars. We propose to announce these presentations with our newsletter and calendar so that people can go to the corresponding lab if they are interested.

- If we manage to invite some well-known speakers, we could host some special seminars.

### Training

- During working sessions, you will probably be refered to some online content in order to learn more about R.

- MaiMoSiNE proposes to announce our working sessions and maybe some experience users could participate in their training courses as teachers. They think our working sessions and their training courses will complement one another.

### Get some help

- A [map and table with members](members.html) of the R group is available. One could contact people with some specific skills (referenced in the table). Don't hesitate to register by following the quick guidelines!

- A [gitter](https://gitter.im/R-in-Grenoble) is available to help people discuss with each other.
